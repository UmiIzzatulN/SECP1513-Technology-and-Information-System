## ✍️ Group Reflection
From this presentation, we learned that while university builds a strong foundation of theoretical knowledge, it is not always sufficient to meet the demands of real-world jobs. The ICT industry values professionals who are adaptable, proactive, and capable of working in teams and solving real-world problems.
