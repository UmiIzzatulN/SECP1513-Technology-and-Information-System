## 📘 Overview

This project explores how Big Data and AI can improve education by analyzing student learning patterns and adapting content in real time. Using the Design Thinking approach, we created SmartEdu, a personalized learning system that supports different learning styles through data-driven recommendations.
<br><br>
## 🎯 Objective

To design a learning platform that personalizes education for students with different learning styles by using:
- AI recommendation
- Real-time progress tracking
- Gamified lessons
- Adaptive learning content
<br><br>
## 🧠 Design Thinking Process

1. **Empathize** – Interviews with students/teachers  
2. **Define** – Problem: Lack of personalized learning  
3. **Ideate** – Brainstormed features like AI tutor, analytics  
4. **Prototype** – Built in Figma  
5. **Test** – Feedback and improvements planned
<br><br>
##  📌 Conclusion
This project shows how Design Thinking helps turn complex challenges into user-centered solutions. By empathizing with students and exploring their real learning needs, we used Big Data and AI to design a system that responds to those needs meaningfully. This approach proves that when technology is guided by empathy and creativity, it can lead to impactful innovations in education.
