## 🧠 Personal Reflection

Chapter 3 has deepened my understanding of how software enables hardware to function effectively. I learned how system software acts as the backbone of all operations — from starting the computer to running user applications. The breakdown of its types helped me see how different components like operating systems, device drivers, and utilities work together.
This chapter gave me a broader perspective on what happens behind the scenes in every computing experience — and why understanding software is just as important as understanding hardware.
